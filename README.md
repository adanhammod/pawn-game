# ‚ôüÔ∏è Pawn Game

---

 üéØ This Python project, developed with the Pygame module for the graphical user interface (GUI), implements an AI agent for a pawn chess game. The AI utilizes the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to make strategic decisions. It dynamically adjusts its search depth depending on time constraints and incorporates heuristic evaluations to ensure efficient, competitive gameplay.

##### üéÆ Game Description:

The game is played between two players -White and Black- on an 8x8 chessboard.

* White goes first.
* Each player starts with 8 pawns, placed on the second row for White and the seventh row for Black.
* Players alternate turns, moving one pawn per turn.

The movement rules for pawns are as follows:

* Pawns move **one square forward**.
* Pawns can **capture an opponent's pawn diagonally**.
* A pawn **cannot move forward** if an opponent's pawn blocks the adjacent square.
* **In the opening**, pawns can move **two squares forward** if both squares are empty.
* If an opponent's pawn is on an adjacent horizontal square and a pawn moves two squares forward, the opponent may capture it as if the pawn only moved one square (this rule is valid only for the next move ‚Äì known as "en passant").

##### **üèÜ Winning Conditions:**

The game is won if one of the following conditions occurs:

* A player successfully moves a pawn to the last row.
* A player successfully captures all of the opponent's pawns.
* A player causes a situation where the opponent has no legal moves left.

##### Installation:

Download the repository and install the necessary Python module:

`pip install pygame `

##### üöÄ Running the Pawn Game:

This project offers two gameplay modes:

1. **Main Function Mode:**
   - In this stand-alone mode, the player controls one side of the chessboard, while the AI automatically computes its moves on the other side.
2. **Server-Client Mode:**
   - In this mode, the game is played through a server-client interaction and supports two configurations:
     * **User vs AI:** The user plays one side, and the AI plays the other.
     * **AI vs AI:** Both sides are controlled by AI agents, enabling automated gameplay between two AIs.

**Running the Game in Server-Client Mode:**

    **a.** Start the Server:

* Open a terminal and run the following command to start the server:

```
 python server.py
```

   **b.** Start the AI Client (Playing as White):

- Open another terminal window and run the following command for the AI client:

```
 python client.py
```

    **c.** Start the User Client (Playing as Black):

* In third terminal window, run the following command for the user client:

```
 python humanClient.py
```

- Alternatively, you can run another `client.py` to play as the AI-controlled player on the Black side.
